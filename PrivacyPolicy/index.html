    <h1>Privacy Policy for ABC - Learning Vehicles App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 17, 2025</p>

    <p>The <strong>ABC - Learning Vehicles</strong> app ("App") is a service provided by Arief Hidayat ("Service Provider"). This is an ad-supported service, designed for use by individuals of various age groups, including children. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect user information, as well as how we comply with regulations related to children's data protection.</p>

    </ul>

        <li>Offer content appropriate for all age groups, without differentiation between specific age categories</li>
        <li>Display ads that comply with applicable policies and are appropriate for the user's age group</li>
        <li>Deliver important information, notifications, and promotional marketing as necessary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Family Policy and Compliance with Regulations</h2>
    <p>As this App targets users of various age groups, including children, we are committed to complying with applicable regulations on children's data protection, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> - We comply with U.S. law to protect the personal data of children under the age of 13.</li>
        <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> - We respect the privacy of users in the EU and ensure that personal data is collected and processed with explicit consent from parents or guardians for children under 16.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The App implements <strong>age verification</strong> to ensure users under the age of 13 cannot access inappropriate content and to limit the collection of personal data from children. This age verification process ensures compliance with applicable policies and regulations.</p>

    <h2>4. Ads</h2>
    <p>To ensure ads are appropriate for the user's age, we only show ads that are suitable for children when the App is used by users under 18 years old. These ads are sourced from Google Play certified ad networks or directly managed by us, including ads for our own apps or those from partnerships with other brands.</p>
    <p>Specifically, this App complies with Google Play's advertising policy, which requires that ads displayed to children adhere to guidelines designed for that age group.</p>
